## Students resonsibilities {#students}

As a student, you are expected to complete documents for the University as part of the myPlacement application at [studentmobility.manchester.ac.uk](https://studentmobility.manchester.ac.uk/). This includes: **UNIV+: Work Placement Declaration **(subject to updates, check online for latest version). This document sets out some of your responsibilities. When you sign the document, you agree to the following:

1. You will declare any disability or serious, unstable or difficult to manage physical or mental health conditions to my placement administrator at the earliest opportunity. You understand that my placement administrator will work alongside specialist services, such as the Disability Advisory and Support Service and Occupational Health, to investigate the support systems available to you from your employer and any additional funding that you may be entitled to.
1. For your attention: By sharing information with The University of Manchester about a disability or serious, unstable or difficult to manage physical or mental health conditions, you enable us to provide any necessary additional support during the application process, pre-departure preparation and during your placement.
1. It is rare that a health condition or disability would result in you being unable to participate in a work placement, but you should be aware that the ability to support health conditions or disabilities varies significantly by country.
1. If you have an approved mitigating circumstances case, you will inform your placement administrator at the earliest opportunity.
1. If your placement application is approved, you understand that you will need to complete all requirements, such as the health needs self-assessment. You will take preparation for your placement seriously and understand that it
will require a considerable time commitment.
1. You declare that the information presented in your my placement application and the accompanying documentation is true and complete.

##  Contact with the University whilst on placement 
During your placement, you are a full time student of the University. Outside of prescribed contact points you can contact us directly at any point. If you have any concerns or questions, you can contact the usual teams or the Placements team soe.placements@manchester.ac.uk

As a student at the University and employee of your placement, you should familiarise yourself with the practical and professional requirements including breach of contract of the placement provider and, if relevant, the cultural life of the host country. It is your responsibility to source any additional insurance required over and above the standard University
insurance.

Remember you remain a registered University of Manchester student and must conduct yourself accordingly and with due regard to the University’s requirements and regulations and must adhere to the
[University’s Conduct and Discipline of Students: Regulations XVII](https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/DocuInfo.aspx?DocID=6530) [@regulations]

Once your placement has been formally approved by the Placement academic, you should complete the UNIV+: Work Placement Statement of Commitment (subject to updates, check myPlacement for latest version). This document includes:


1. **Time commitment**: I understand that I must dedicate the necessary time and effort to prepare for my work placement, which includes undertaking independent research, completing any application forms, making my own travel arrangements (if required), obtaining the relevant immigration documents if my
placement is overseas, arranging my own accommodation, adhering to deadlines, and attending all required briefings.
1. **Costs**: I have researched any additional costs that may be involved in undertaking a work placement, such as accommodation or travel, and I am confident that I can cover any extra expenses involved. I understand that should I decide to return early from placement / not successfully obtain a visa (if required), I will not be entitled to a reimbursement of costs and will need to pay back any additional funding or scholarships that I may have received.
1. **Declaration of disabilities or health conditions**: I understand that I should declare any disability or serious, unstable or difficult to manage health condition, including mental health conditions, to my placement administrator as early as possible, so that I can access any necessary support. I recognise that failure to declare any disabilities or serious, unstable or difficult to manage health conditions, or doing so later in the process, will limit the amount of support available to me, or could have implications for my participation in the exchange programme.
1. **Emergency contacts**: In the event of an emergency, I give The University of Manchester permission to communicate with my named emergency contact person(s), partner university staff and appropriate University services (specifically the University insurance provider and emergency assistance provider) regarding all issues surrounding my exchange placement. This may include but is not limited to student account information, student conduct issues, health and safety, or academic concerns; such contact
may occur before, during, or after the programme.
