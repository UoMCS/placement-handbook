# Welcome to Industrial Experience (IE) {-}

Welcome to the Industrial Experience (IE) placement handbook. This book is primarily for undergraduate students studying Computer Science in the School of Engineering at the University of Manchester. The handbook has been written to help you (and your personal tutor) before, during and after your year-long placement in industry.

## The Placements Team in Computer Science {#team}

The placements team are here to provide support for your Industrial Experience alongside the support you get from your employer. The team consists of:

1. **Duncan Hull**: Employability lead, Computer Science [manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact), see figure \@ref(fig:team-fig)
1. **David Petrescu**: Placement year tutor for Industrial Experience in Computer Science [manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/david-petrescu](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/david-petrescu),  see figure \@ref(fig:team-fig)
1. **Your personal tutor**: in _most_ cases this will be the same personal tutor you had in first year. If you are not sure who your personal tutor is, get in touch with the second year tutor listed in undergraduate handbook [@ughandbook] and the [Monday Mail](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/mondaymail/) [@mondaymail] 
1. **The placements admin team**: A group of professional services staff providing adminstrative support in the School of Engineering, see section \@ref(contacts)
1. **Your employer**: Principally your line manager(s), colleagues and [Human Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources) (HR) department, see chapter \@ref(employers)

Some of the placements team above are pictured in figure \@ref(fig:team-fig).


## What is an Industrial Experience placement year? {#placement}

A Industrial Experience (IE) placement is a formal period of paid work that is an assessed part of your study as an undergraduate. [@whatisie] The length of the employment varies with employers. In **this** guide a placement (also known a year-in-industry or sandwich year) is a **full year** of paid employment. Placements take place in the penultimate year of your study, for Bachelors students, that's _after_ your second year of study and _before_ your final year of study.

* a placement is _not_ a summer internship, although these are also good things to do and lots of students do them
* the usual duration of a placement is 12 months, typically starting between June and August, depending on the employer. At the University of Manchester, the minimum length of employment for placements is 9 months, though 12 months is much more common. 


During your placement you are a both full-time student and an employee of an organisation at the same time. 

Placements aren't the _only_ way to get experience before you graduate, but they are one of the most popular. For a discussion advantages and disadvantages of placement years over summer internships see [cdyf.me/experiencing#interns](https://www.cdyf.me/experiencing#interns) [@experiencing]


## Placement year fees for IE {#fees}

You pay reduced tuition fees for your placement year, these are not the full tuition fees you pay while studying at University full time, although for tax purposes you are still a full-time student, see section \@ref(taxes). The fees you pay depend on if you are an international student (or not) see [Study Abroad, Placements and Other fees](https://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/finances/tuition-fees/fee-amounts/other-fees/) [@fees]
