# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the placement manual, this handbook is for undergraduate students studying Computer Science at the University of Manchester before, during and after their Industrial Experience (IE) placements in industry.

## The Placements Team in Computer Science {#team}

The placements team are here to support you on placement alongside the support you get from your employer: 

1. **Duncan Hull**: Employability lead, Computer Science [manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/duncan.hull/contact), see figure \@ref(fig:team-fig)
1. **David Petrescu**: Placement year tutor, Computer Science [manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/david-petrescu](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/david-petrescu),  see figure \@ref(fig:team-fig)
1. **Your personal tutor**: in _most_ cases this is the will be the same personal tutor you had in first year. If you're not sure who your personal tutor is, get in touch with the second year tutor listed in undergraduate handbook [@ughandbook] and the [Monday Mail](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/mondaymail/) [@mondaymail] 
1. **The placements admin team** in the School of Engineering, see section \@ref(contacts)
1. **Your employer**, your line manager(s) and Human Resources (HR) department, see chapter \@ref(employers)

## What is a placement year? {#placement}

A placement is a formal period of paid work that is an assessed part of your study as an undergraduate. [@whatisie] The length of the employment varies, in this guide a placement (also known a year-in-industry or  sandwich year) is a **full year** of paid employment. Placements take place in the penultimate year of your study, for Bachelors students, that's after your second year of study.

* a placement is _not_ a summer internship, although these are also good things to do and lots of students do them
* the usual duration of a placement is 12 months, typically starting between June and August, depending on the employer. At the University of Manchester, the minimum length of employment for placements is 9 months, though 12 months is much more common. 


During your placement you are a both full-time student and an employee of an organisation at the same time.


## Placement year fees {#fees}

You pay reduced tuition fees for your placement year, these are not the full tuition fees you pay while studying at University full time. The amount you pay depends on if you are an international student (or not) see [Study Abroad, Placements and Other fees](https://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/finances/tuition-fees/fee-amounts/other-fees/) [@fees]
