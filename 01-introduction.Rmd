Studying  engineering at the University of Manchester helps students to gain technical skills and knowlege in lectures, laboratories, and during projects both in individual and team-based roles. With this engineering knowledge students will be able to solve problems, develop new ideas, and design innovative solutions to solve a wide spectrum of engineering and social problems.

While working for an employer, graduate engineers gain valuable experience and in many cases discover what they really like and what to focus their working life on in the long term. The “with Industrial Experience” (wIE) scheme of our courses provides a valuable opportunity for students to obtain experience working as an early-career engineer in the real world within the period of their degree programme. There are many advantages to this, including:

* The experience of industrially focused engineering and applying it to real-world scenarios
* The responsibilities associated with industrial employment.
* Working within a team 
* The satisfaction of contributing to engineering products that will influence the future development of society.
* The consolidation of a education with that of the engineering environment
* The increased likelihood of job offers after graduation.
*  For many, the year in industry is the transformation from student to engineer, from student to professional

There are many advantages for employers who host students on placmeent 

* The opportunity to have a year-long “interviews” with undergraduates who have two years (or more) experience at university.
* The ability to familiarise students with in-house methods leading to fast-track interviewing and graduate
training as a prospective future employee.
* Access to high quality students as industrial trainees who can then offer the company valuable resources and new ideas.
* Employers with a long-term commitment to the placement of students will have access to future potential recruits by maintaining contact with the Department through the wIE team.

We hope that you enjoy and make the most of your placement year in industry and wish you the best of luck!
