(ref:captionnotuk) It is possible to do your industrial experience year outside the UK provided you have the right to work in that country, or an employer is willing to sponsor the appropriate working visa for you.

For example CERN is common. although YOU (and your employer) will need to sort out an appropriate visa that allows you to work in that country. For example, working the USA requires a J-1 visa - youâ€™d need to find a sponsor. There is more information from the careers service on [Finding international jobs. Information for students looking for opportunities outside the UK](https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/international/internationaljobs/) [@interjobs]

The University requires that the employer meets certain requirements before we approve year-long placements. Approval for summer internships is only required if they are part of the integrated masters (MEng) programme, speak to the MEng tutor.

In some cases you can apply for funding from third parties such as the Turing Scheme which provides funding that was previously available through the Erasmus Programme of the European Union. [@turing]
