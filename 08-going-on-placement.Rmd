You've done well to find a placement, graduate application ratios hit a record high of `140:1` this year. [@ratio]  This confirms what you've probably already found out about the job market being tough for everyone including:

* summer internships
* year long placements
* graduate vacancies 

So, you've done well to find a placement in a very competitve job market, give yourself a pat on the back!

## Dive, Survive or Thrive {#thrive}
Crudely speaking there are three scenarios for your placement year show in figure \@ref(fig:survival-fig):

1. Dive - you **won't meet** the expectations of your emxployer
1. Survive - you **will meet** the expectations of your employer
1. Thrive - you will **exceed** the expectaons of your employer

Most students **meet** or **exceed** the expectations of their employers. We want to help you achieve while avoiding the first scenario and pointing you to help and advice if you are struggling on placement.

## Resitting exams {#resits}
