## Congratulations! {#congrats}
You've done very well to find a placement during a year when graduate application ratios hit a record high of `140:1`. This means that in 2014 the average _graduate_ vacancy had 140 applicants, with similar ratios for placement year applicants. [@ratio]  This confirms what you've probably already found out in your job hunting. It is an incredibly tough job market for _everyone_ at the moment and that includes students seeking employment through:

* summer internships
* year-long Industrial Experience placements
* graduate vacancies 

So, you've done incredibly well to find a placement in a very competitve job market. Give yourself a pat on the back!

## Dive, Survive or Thrive? {#thrive}
Crudely speaking there are three scenarios for your placement year show in figure \@ref(fig:survival-fig):

1. Dive - you **won't meet** the expectations of your employer
1. Survive - you **will meet** the expectations of your employer
1. Thrive - you will **exceed** the expectaons of your employer

Most students **meet** or **exceed** the expectations of their employers. We want to help you achieve while avoiding the first scenario and pointing you to help and advice if you are struggling on placement.

<!--## Don't forget to read your email {#email} -->

## Resitting exams {#resits} 

If you fail any of your second year exams, you may need to resit them. This doesn't prevent you from doing your placement, but you will need to negotiate some time off to resit any exams and these will need to be done in person in Manchester. [@resits]


## Don't forget to read your University email! {#email} 
Your employer will expect you to read your work email on a regular basis, we also expect you to read your University email `@student.manchester.ac.uk` too as it is our primary form of communication with you on your Industrial Experience placement.

For example, your personal tutor and the placement year tutor will be sending you important information by email, so please make sure you read it regularly, somewhere between once a day and once a week.
