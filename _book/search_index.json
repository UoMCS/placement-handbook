"],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 TODO: What is a placement", " Chapter 1 Introduction Studying engineering at the University of Manchester helps students to gain technical skills and knowlege in lectures, laboratories, and during projects both in individual and team-based roles. With this engineering knowledge students will be able to solve problems, develop new ideas, and design innovative solutions to solve a wide spectrum of engineering and social problems. While working for an employer, graduate engineers gain valuable experience and in many cases discover what they really like and what to focus their working life on in the long term. The “with Industrial Experience” (wIE) scheme of our courses provides a valuable opportunity for students to obtain experience working as an early-career engineer in the real world within the period of their degree programme. There are many advantages to this, including: The experience of industrially focused engineering and applying it to real-world scenarios The responsibilities associated with industrial employment. Working within a team The satisfaction of contributing to engineering products that will influence the future development of society. The consolidation of a education with that of the engineering environment The increased likelihood of job offers after graduation. For many, the year in industry is the transformation from student to engineer, from student to professional There are many advantages for employers who host students on placmeent The opportunity to have a year-long “interviews” with undergraduates who have two years (or more) experience at university. The ability to familiarise students with in-house methods leading to fast-track interviewing and graduate training as a prospective future employee. Access to high quality students as industrial trainees who can then offer the company valuable resources and new ideas. Employers with a long-term commitment to the placement of students will have access to future potential recruits by maintaining contact with the Department through the wIE team. We hope that you enjoy and make the most of your placement year in industry and wish you the best of luck! 1.1 TODO: What is a placement "],["aims-and-intended-learning-outcomes.html", "Chapter 2 Aims and Intended Learning Outcomes 2.1 Developing your digital capabilities 2.2 What are digital capabilities? 2.3 Exploring your digital capabilities 2.4 Recording your development", " Chapter 2 Aims and Intended Learning Outcomes The Learning outcomes for the placement year are To learn how to operate in a professional environment To apply the skills and knowledge you’ve learned at University in the workplace To grow as a professional by seeking out development opportunities to acquire new skills and knowledge in the workplace To meet (or exceed) the expectation of your employer, as set out in your contract of employment To describe your development as a professional in a short written report Some of this will involve developing skills and knowledge beyond your University curriculum such as softer skills and digital capabilities, described below. 2.1 Developing your digital capabilities Throughout your time at The University of Manchester you will be supported to develop the digital capabilities needed for your studies and future careers. Your placement experience will provide you with further authentic digital development opportunities. The following information is intended to help you record and articulate your capabilities, supporting your development and further enhancing your employability. 2.2 What are digital capabilities? Digital capabilities enable us to ‘live, learn and work in a digital society.’ This profile provides further information about the capabilities University students might expect to develop; it is important to contextualise these, so they are relevant to you and your studies. 2.3 Exploring your digital capabilities The Jisc Discovery tool is a supportive online tool, that can help you understand and develop your digital capabilities. By completing a question set within the tool you can gain a personalised report that includes links to suggested resources in the tool’s resource bank to support your further development. It is recommended that you repeat the question sets annually, to recognise your progress across the different elements of digital capability. You can access the Discovery tool through My Learning Essentials: Develop your digital capabilities resource. education.library.manchester.ac.uk/none-programme-content/digital-capabilities/ My Skills Development – on CareerConnect careers.manchester.ac.uk/findjobs/skills/myskills These resources support you in reflecting on your development on your reports - providing an action plan template for you to complete. For placement students, we recommend taking the: ‘Current student’ digital capability question set, which provides an in-depth exploration of your digital confidence and experience. ‘Digital skills in AI and generative AI’ question set, which also has its own resource bank 2.4 Recording your development From work with employers, we know they value narratives around how you have developed your skills and capabilities through your studies. You can use the language from your Discovery tool reports to update your CV / online professional profile to help you record your digital development. This blog by the Careers Service can further support you with capturing and articulating the capabilities you develop during your placement.

You will need to prepare and debug your CV, as covered in COMP101 and COMP2CARS, see Debugging your Future (Hull 2025a) You need to find and apply for jobs, see Finding your Future (Hull 2025b) Your placement needs to be something broadly related to your degree but this can encompass a wide variety of activities from business analysis, software engineering, software testing, hardware design, data science etc. You can self-arrange a placement but it needs to be approved before you can go on placement. You will need to have job interviews, assessment centres etc on-line or in person, sometimes multiple rounds If you are made job offers that you’d like to accept you need tell us about it, BEFORE you sign any formal contract of employment 3.3 Grade requirements There are no minimum grade requirements besides passing the first and second year of your degree. The placement year doesn’t count towards your degree classification, but it does appear in the title of your degree e.g. BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Industrial Experience: instead of BSc (Hons) Computer Science: the ``vanilla’’ degree 3.4 Grade requirements You MUST do the following if you want to do Industrial Experience (IE): CHECK your visa. If you’re not a UK or EU student and have a Student visa, you will need to extend your visa an extra year to include your placement year if you’re not already registered on IE. See Student Visas: Changing your Course (Anon 2025d) REGISTER for the appropriate degree programme with IE (if you’re not already) by completing a programme change form. You can do this at any point during your second year Bachelors (or third year MEng) up until the end of July of the year that you start your placement SUBMIT your application for placement as soon as you’ve received an offer of employment by filling in the form at MyPlacement: studentmobility.manchester.ac.uk. You can do this by clicking on “work experiences” &gt; “computer science”. The Placement Journey infographic takes you through the process step by step. Placements outside the UK are subject to additional checks and approval, for example we need to ensure employers have employers liability insurance or an equivalent WAIT for our approval BEFORE you make any concrete arrangements to start work, such as signing a contract of employment, moving house, flying to another country etc References ———. 2025d. “Student Visas: Changing Your Course.” https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=37044.

The differences are: The IE year is taken after year three, not year two To stay on the MEng programme you must have a year end average of at least 60% in years one and two. If you don’t, you’ll be transferred to the equivalent bachelor’s programme. If your year three average is below 60% you will graduate. The Meng students who don’t do an IE year will do a short (9 – 12 week) placement over the summer between years three and four. The placement is assessed in COMP40901 by a report you submit at the end of September and a seminar you give during Reading Week. This unit is worth 25 credits of the final year.
