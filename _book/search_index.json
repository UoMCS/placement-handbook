A placement is a formal period of paid work that is an assessed part of your study as an undergraduate. (Service 2025c) The length of the employment varies, in this guide a placement (also known a year-in-industry or sandwich year) is a full year of paid employment. Placements take place in the penultimate year of your study, for Bachelors students, that’s after your second year of study. a placement is not a summer internship, although these are also good things to do and lots of students do them the usual duration of a placement is 12 months, typically starting between June and August, depending on the employer. At the University of Manchester, the minimum length of employment for placements is 9 months, though 12 months is much more common. During your placement you are a both full-time student and an employee of an organisation at the same time. 0.3 Placement year fees You pay reduced tuition fees for your placement year, these are not the full tuition fees you pay while studying at University full time. The amount you pay depends on if you are an international student (or not) see Study Abroad, Placements and Other fees (Support 2025b) References ———. 2025c. “What Is a Placement?” https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/findjobs/placement/. ———. 2025b. “Study Abroad, Placements and Other Fees.” https://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/finances/tuition-fees/fee-amounts/other-fees/.

With this engineering knowledge students will be able to solve problems, develop new ideas, and design innovative solutions to solve a wide spectrum of engineering and social problems. (advice 2025) 1.1 The value of industrial experience for you While working for an employer, students gain valuable experience and in many cases discover what they really like and what to focus their working life on in the long term. The “with Industrial Experience” (wIE) scheme of our courses provides a valuable opportunity for students to obtain experience working as an early-career engineer in the real world within the period of their degree programme. There are many advantages to this, including: The experience of industrially focused engineering and applying it to real-world scenarios The responsibilities associated with industrial employment. Working within a team The satisfaction of contributing to engineering products that will influence the future development of society. The consolidation of a education with that of the engineering environment The increased likelihood of job offers after graduation. For many, the year in industry is the transformation from student to engineer, from student to professional 1.2 The value of industrial experience for your employer There are many advantages for employers who host students on placmeent The opportunity to have a year-long “interviews” with undergraduates who have two years (or more) experience at university. The ability to familiarise students with in-house methods leading to fast-track interviewing and graduate training as a prospective future employee. Access to high quality students as industrial trainees who can then offer the company valuable resources and new ideas. Employers with a long-term commitment to the placement of students will have access to future potential recruits by maintaining contact with the Department through the wIE team. We hope that you enjoy and make the most of your placement year in industry and wish you the best of luck!

You may have done some group work during your undergraduate study, but most of the assessment at University (and school) is based on your individual performance such as: Exam performance: exams try to measure your skills and knowledge as an individual Coursework: most coursework tend to be solo projects, that you do on your own The workplace is different. You will probably spend more time collaborating with more diverse teams of people. This means that professional skills, sometimes called soft skills (Advisor 2025), are important such as: Teamwork Leadership Adaptability Negotiation Communication: reading, writing, speaking and listening Your placement is an opportunity to develop these professional skills, while also deepening and broadening your technical knowledge. 2.2 Audit your skills We require students to audit their skills at the beginning and end of their placements. Your employer will probably ask you to do something similar during your regular meetings with your manager. Figure 2.1: Completing a skills audit will help you develop your self-awareness and better articulate what you have to offer to prospective employers, find out more at bit.ly/manchester-skills-audit 2.3 Exploring your digital capabilities Part of becoming a professional means developing your digital capabilities. Digital capabilities enable us to ‘live, learn and work in a digital society.’ The Jisc Discovery tool is a supportive online tool, that can help you understand and develop your digital capabilities. By completing a question set within the tool you can gain a personalised report that includes links to suggested resources in the tool’s resource bank to support your further development. It is recommended that you repeat the question sets annually, to recognise your progress across the different elements of digital capability. You can access the Discovery tool through My Learning Essentials: Develop your digital capabilities resource. education.library.manchester.ac.uk/none-programme-content/digital-capabilities/ My Skills Development – on CareerConnect careers.manchester.ac.uk/findjobs/skills/myskills These resources support you in reflecting on your development on your reports - providing an action plan template for you to complete. For placement students, we recommend taking the: ‘Current student’ digital capability question set, which provides an in-depth exploration of your digital confidence and experience. ‘Digital skills in AI and generative AI’ question set, which also has its own resource bank 2.4 Recording your development From work with employers, we know they value narratives around how you have developed your skills and capabilities through your studies. You can use the language from your Discovery tool reports to update your CV / online professional profile to help you record your digital development. This blog by the Careers Service can further support you with capturing and articulating the capabilities you develop during your placement.

Bachelors students can change onto and off IE any point up until the end of your see studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/changedegree.php You have received a job offer and make an application for IE via MyPlacement at studentmobility.manchester.ac.uk The University formally approves your placement application You accept the job offer from the employer and sign a contract of employment 3.2 Finding a placmeent The basic requirements might sound simple but finding a suitable placement requires lots of work on your part and you’ll have to balance this with your study. You will need to prepare and debug your CV, as covered in COMP101 and COMP2CARS, see Debugging your Future (Hull 2025a) You need to find and apply for jobs, see Finding your Future (Hull 2025b) Your placement needs to be something broadly related to your degree but this can encompass a wide variety of activities from business analysis, software engineering, software testing, hardware design, data science etc. You can self-arrange a placement but it needs to be approved before you can go on placement. You will need to have job interviews, assessment centres etc on-line or in person, sometimes multiple rounds If you are made job offers that you’d like to accept you need tell us about it, BEFORE you sign any formal contract of employment 3.3 Grade requirements There are no minimum grade requirements besides passing the first and second year of your degree. The placement year doesn’t count towards your degree classification, but it does appear in the title of your degree e.g. BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Industrial Experience: instead of BSc (Hons) Computer Science: the ``vanilla’’ degree 3.4 Visa requirements You MUST do the following if you want to do Industrial Experience (IE): CHECK your visa. If you’re not a UK or EU student and have a Student visa, you will need to extend your visa an extra year to include your placement year if you’re not already registered on IE. See Student Visas: Changing your Course (Administrator 2025e) 3.5 Working in the UK UK and EU residents have the right to work in the UK.
