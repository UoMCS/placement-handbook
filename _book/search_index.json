If you’re not sure who your personal tutor is, get in touch with the second year tutor listed in undergraduate handbook (Nutter, 2024) and the Monday Mail (Nutter, 2025) The placements admin team in the School of Engineering, see section 11 Your employer, your line manager(s) and Human Resources (HR) department, see chapter 6 Figure 0.1: Duncan Hull (left) employability lead for the Department of Computer Science and David Petrescu, Industrial Experience year tutor for your placement year. 0.2 What is a placement year? A placement is a formal period of paid work that is an assessed part of your study as an undergraduate. (Mallon, 2025h) The length of the employment varies, in this guide a placement (also known a year-in-industry or sandwich year) is a full year of paid employment. Placements take place in the penultimate year of your study, for Bachelors students, that’s after your second year of study. a placement is not a summer internship, although these are also good things to do and lots of students do them the usual duration of a placement is 12 months, typically starting between June and August, depending on the employer. At the University of Manchester, the minimum length of employment for placements is 9 months, though 12 months is much more common. During your placement you are a both full-time student and an employee of an organisation at the same time. 0.3 Placement year fees You pay reduced tuition fees for your placement year, these are not the full tuition fees you pay while studying at University full time. The amount you pay depends on if you are an international student (or not) see Study Abroad, Placements and Other fees (Support, 2025c) 0.4 How this handbook is structured The rest of this placement handbook is structured as follows: Chapter 1 outlines the value of a placement for you, your employer and your University Chapter 2 describes the aims of your Industrial Experience (IE) year Chapter 3 describes the requirements that need to be met for IE Chapter 4 discusses placements outside the UK Chapter 5 outlines your responsibilities to your employer and the University Chapter 7 describes the obligations of the University to you while you are on placement Chapter 8 is a starter guide for those finishign their second year of study Chapter 9 describes how your placement year is assessed Chapter 10 is the guide for your personal tutor who visits you on placement Chapter 11 lists all the contacts you’ll need for your year in industry 0.5 Editing this handbook We have tried to make this handbook as useful as possible but if you spot any errors or omissions, we appreciate your contributions.

With this knowledge you will be able to solve problems, develop new ideas, and design innovative solutions to solve a wide range of engineering and social problems. A year of Industrial Experience (IE) will consolidate, broaden and deepen what you are taught at University while preparing you for your final year of study back at University. 1.1 The value of IE for you You will gain valuable experience and can further explore your career interests while you are on Industrial Experience. (advice, 2025) The “with Industrial Experience” (IE) scheme of our undergraduate degrees provides a valuable opportunity for you to experience employment before you graduate. There are many advantages to this, including: The experience of industrially focused engineering and applying it to real-world scenarios The responsibilities associated with commercial employment Working within a team, collaborating with the wider organisation that you have joined The satisfaction of contributing to products and serfvices that will influence the future development of society The consolidation of your education to date The increased likelihood of return (or extended) job offers after graduation. It is common for students who perform well to receive return offers from their placement providers For many, Industrial Experience is the start of a transformation from student to engineer and from student to professional 1.2 The value of IE for your employer There are many advantages for employers who host students on placement: The opportunity to have a year-long “interviews” with undergraduate students who have two years (or more) experience at university. The ability to familiarise students with working practices leading to fast-track interviewing and graduate training as a prospective future employee. Access to high quality students as industrial trainees who can offer the employer valuable resources and fresh insights Employers with a long-term commitment to the placement of students will have access to potential recruits by maintaining contact with the University through the student 1.3 The value of IE to the University The are many advantages to the University of you doing a placement year The Unversity produces better graduates because you will develop skills and gain knowledge that are difficult to teach and learn in a traditional academic environment Graduates from the University with placements get paid more, get better jobs and progress more quickly in their chosen careers. We know this from many different sources such as the annual graduateoutcomes.ac.uk survey Students returning from placements tend to do much better final year (honours) projects and perform better in exams and coursework 1.4 Win win win? So placements can be a win-win-win situation for all three parties involved: they are a win for your employer, see section 1.2 they are a win for the University, see section 1.3 the are a win for you, see section 1.1 So, we hope that you enjoy and make the most of your placement year in industry and wish you the best of luck! References "],["aims.html", "Chapter 2 Aims of Industrial Experience 2.1 Developing your professional skills 2.2 Audit your skills 2.3 Exploring your digital capabilities 2.4 Recording your development", " Chapter 2 Aims of Industrial Experience The Learning outcomes for the placement year are To learn how to operate in a professional environment To apply the skills and knowledge you’ve learned at University in the workplace as directed by your employer To grow as a professional by seeking out development opportunities to acquire new skills and knowledge in the workplace To meet (or exceed) the expectations of your employer, as set out in your contract of employment To describe your development as a professional in a short written report and (optionally) to share that with other students on your course Some of this will involve developing softer skills, digital skills and knowledge beyond your University curriculum, some of which are described below. 2.1 Developing your professional skills Engineering education tends to focus on technical skills and knowledge, while these are important, they are not everything that you’ll need to succeeed as a professional. Figure 2.1: Completing a skills audit will help you develop your self-awareness and better articulate what you have to offer to prospective employers, find out more at www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/options/skills/myskills [@] You may have done some group work during your undergraduate study, but most of the assessment at University (and school) is based on your individual performance such as: Exam performance: exams try to measure your skills and knowledge as an individual, collaboration (as in plagiarism) is punished Coursework submission: most coursework tends to be solo projects, that you do on your own, collaboration (as in plagiarism) is usually punished The workplace is different. You will probably spend a significant amout of time collaborating with more diverse teams of people than you did at University. This means that professional skills, sometimes called soft skills (Advisor, 2025; Mallon, 2025g, 2025f), are important such as: Teamwork Leadership Adaptability Negotiation Communication: reading, writing, speaking and listening Your placement is an opportunity to develop these professional skills, while also deepening and broadening your technical knowledge. 2.2 Audit your skills We require students to audit their skills at the beginning and end of their placements. Your employer will probably ask you to do something similar during your regular meetings with your manager. 2.3 Exploring your digital capabilities Part of becoming a professional means developing your digital capabilities. Digital capabilities enable us to ‘live, learn and work in a digital society.’ The Jisc Discovery tool is a supportive online tool, that can help you understand and develop your digital capabilities. By completing a question set within the tool you can gain a personalised report that includes links to suggested resources in the tool’s resource bank to support your further development. It is recommended that you repeat the question sets annually, to recognise your progress across the different elements of digital capability. You can access the Discovery tool through My Learning Essentials: Develop your digital capabilities resource. education.library.manchester.ac.uk/none-programme-content/digital-capabilities/ My Skills Development – on CareerConnect www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/options/skills/myskills/ (Mallon, 2025e) These resources support you in reflecting on your development on your reports - providing an action plan template for you to complete. For placement students, we recommend taking the: ‘Current student’ digital capability question set, which provides an in-depth exploration of your digital confidence and experience. ‘Digital skills in AI and generative AI’ question set, which also has its own resource bank 2.4 Recording your development From work with employers, we know they value narratives around how you have developed your skills and capabilities through your studies. You can use the language from your Discovery tool reports to update your CV / online professional profile to help you record your digital development. This blog by the Careers Service can further support you with capturing and articulating the capabilities you develop during your placement.

Bachelors students can change onto and off IE any point up until the end of your by filling in the change of degree form, either in print or pdf and getting it signed-off by the year tutor and employability lead (Administrator, 2025e) You have received a job offer and make an application for IE via My Placement at (Administrator, 2025i) The University formally approves your placement application before you start work You formally accept the job offer from the employer and sign a contract of employment 3.2 Finding a placemeent The basic requirements might sound simple but finding a suitable placement requires a significant amount of your time and energy, and you’ll have to balance these requirements with those of your study. You will need to prepare and debug your CV, as covered in COMP101 and COMP2CARS, see Debugging Your Future (Hull, 2025a) You need to find and apply for jobs, see Finding Your Future (Hull, 2025b) Your placement needs to be something broadly related to your degree but this can encompass a wide variety of activities from business analysis, software engineering, software testing, hardware design, data science etc. You can self-arrange a placement but it needs to be approved before you can go on placement. You will need to attend any job interviews, assessment centres etc on-line or in person, sometimes multiple rounds, that you apply to If you are made job offer that you’d like to accept you need tell us about it, BEFORE you sign any formal contract of employment 3.3 Grade requirements There are no minimum grade requirements besides passing the first and second year of your degree. The placement year doesn’t count towards your degree classification, but it does appear in the title of your degree e.g. BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Industrial Experience: instead of BSc (Hons) Computer Science: the ``vanilla’’ degree 3.4 Visa requirements You MUST do the following if you want to do Industrial Experience (IE): CHECK your visa. If you’re not a UK or EU student and have a Student visa, you will need to extend your visa an extra year to include your placement year if you’re not already registered on IE. See Student Visas: Changing your Course (Administrator, 2025g) 3.5 Your right to work in the UK If you are not a UK resident, a placement year gives you the right to work full time in the UK because it is an assessed part of your undergraduate study. (Mallon, 2025b; Support, 2025b) During term-time, student visa holders are allowed to work up to 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during vacation periods according to the University’s vacation dates (Administrator, 2025c), including Christmas, Easter and Summer. See Student Visas: Working during your Studies (Support, 2025b) 3.6 Working outside the UK It is possible to do a placement year outside the uk, see chapter 4. 3.7 Full-time work on placement For a placement year (with industrial experience) a Student visa allows you to work full-time provided that the employment is part of your study (which an industrial experience year is) this is true for both: Students from the UK and EU Students from outside the UK and EU (e.g. Tier 4 visa holders) This means you don’t need to apply for a work permit, as your Tier 4 visa entitles you to work when it is an integral part of your degree.

(Administrator, 2025h) 4.1 Study Abroad Study Abroad is not currently an option for Computer Science degrees at the University of Manchester, however, you can work abroad (outside the UK) for your placement year. While most students do their placements in the UK, it is possible to do placements outside the UK as well provided you can find a suitable employer and can get (or have) the right to work in the that country.

(Engineer, 2025) To work outside the UK, YOU (and your employer) will need to sort out an appropriate visa that allows you to work in that country. For example, working the USA requires a J-1 visa - you’d need to find a sponsor. There is more information from the careers service on Finding international jobs. Information for students looking for opportunities outside the UK (Mallon, 2025c) GoinGlobal (Mallon, 2025d) The University requires that the employer meets certain requirements before we approve year-long placements. Approval for summer internships is only required if they are part of the integrated masters (MEng) programme, speak to the MEng tutor. In some cases you can apply for funding from third parties such as the Turing Scheme which provides funding that was previously available through the Erasmus Programme of the European Union.

You understand that my placement administrator will work alongside specialist services, such as the Disability Advisory and Support Service and Occupational Health, to investigate the support systems available to you from your employer and any additional funding that you may be entitled to. For your attention: By sharing information with The University of Manchester about a disability or serious, unstable or difficult to manage physical or mental health conditions, you enable us to provide any necessary additional support during the application process, pre-departure preparation and during your placement. It is rare that a health condition or disability would result in you being unable to participate in a work placement, but you should be aware that the ability to support health conditions or disabilities varies significantly by country. If you have an approved mitigating circumstances case, you will inform your placement administrator at the earliest opportunity. If your placement application is approved, you understand that you will need to complete all requirements, such as the health needs self-assessment. You will take preparation for your placement seriously and understand that it will require a considerable time commitment. You declare that the information presented in your my placement application and the accompanying documentation is true and complete. 5.1 Contact with the University whilst on placement During your placement, you are a full time student of the University. Outside of prescribed contact points you can contact us directly at any point. If you have any concerns or questions, you can contact the usual teams or the Placements team soe.placements@manchester.ac.uk As a student at the University and employee of your placement, you should familiarise yourself with the practical and professional requirements including breach of contract of the placement provider and, if relevant, the cultural life of the host country. It is your responsibility to source any additional insurance required over and above the standard University insurance. Remember you remain a registered University of Manchester student and must conduct yourself accordingly and with due regard to the University’s requirements and regulations and must adhere to the University’s Conduct and Discipline of Students: Regulations XVII (Administrator, 2025d) Once your placement has been formally approved by the Placement academic, you should complete the UNIV+: Work Placement Statement of Commitment (subject to updates, check myPlacement for latest version). This document includes: Time commitment: I understand that I must dedicate the necessary time and effort to prepare for my work placement, which includes undertaking independent research, completing any application forms, making my own travel arrangements (if required), obtaining the relevant immigration documents if my placement is overseas, arranging my own accommodation, adhering to deadlines, and attending all required briefings. Costs: I have researched any additional costs that may be involved in undertaking a work placement, such as accommodation or travel, and I am confident that I can cover any extra expenses involved. I understand that should I decide to return early from placement / not successfully obtain a visa (if required), I will not be entitled to a reimbursement of costs and will need to pay back any additional funding or scholarships that I may have received. Declaration of disabilities or health conditions: I understand that I should declare any disability or serious, unstable or difficult to manage health condition, including mental health conditions, to my placement administrator as early as possible, so that I can access any necessary support. I recognise that failure to declare any disabilities or serious, unstable or difficult to manage health conditions, or doing so later in the process, will limit the amount of support available to me, or could have implications for my participation in the exchange programme. Emergency contacts: In the event of an emergency, I give The University of Manchester permission to communicate with my named emergency contact person(s), partner university staff and appropriate University services (specifically the University insurance provider and emergency assistance provider) regarding all issues surrounding my exchange placement.

(Servant, 2025a) You should read your contract of employment carefully before signing it. 6.1 What your employer needs to do Your employer must treat you with respect, just like they would any other employee. Yes you are a student but you’re also an employee like any other. Specifically this means that they must: Give you a fixed term contract of employment. That’s usually 12 months, but anywhere between 9 and 15 months is acceptable, starting between June and September and finishing by the following September in time for the next academic year (Servant, 2025b) Pay you minimum wage or higher. (Servant, 2025c) The job market for computer scientists is such that you will usually be paid more than minimum wage, but some employers (even big ones) pay lower wages. In the UK, placement salaries range from minimum wage to £60k+ depending on the sector and location of the employer, see cdyf.me/finding#undersell (Hull, 2025b) Provide you with projects to work on where you can apply the skills and knowledge you’ve learned at University Help you learn new skills and acquire new knowledge from your colleagues and their customers, clients or other stakeholders Treat you with respect. Although you are probably one of the most junior employees, you should not just be the office dogsbody, who’s main responsbilities are making cups of tea and running errands for your colleagues. 6.2 If your employer treats you unfairly If you don’t think an employer can offer you the working conditions described in section 6.1, we encourage you to look elsewhere for employment before signing a contract of employment. If you feel that your employer has withdrawn conditions in section 6.1while you are employed on a placement year, please speak to your line manager about it and/or get in touch with the placements team sooner rather than later, see section 0.1.
