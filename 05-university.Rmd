# University responsibilities {#university}

The University has a duty of care for students on campus _and_ on placement. In addition to checking that your placement provider is a suitable employer, a academic member of staff from University will also have two scheduled meetings with you during your placement:

1. A one-to-one early on in your placement to check everything is OK, this is usually your personal tutor
2. A three-person meeting nearer the middle or end of your placement with you, your manager and your tutor to talk about your progress, see 

The placement team are on hand throughout the year if you need them
