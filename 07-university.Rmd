```

(ref:captionteams) Your `@student.manchester.ac.uk` email is the main way the University will keep in touch with you while on Industrial Experience. For example, the placement visit meetings described in section \@ref(keydates) will be conducted remotely using either [teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com) or [zoom.com](https://www.zoom.com), you'll be notified about these meetings by email, so please make sure you read your University email regularly.


## Your personal tutor {#tutor}

In addition to checking that your placement provider is a suitable employer, an academic member of staff from University will also have at least two scheduled meetings with you during your placement:

1. A one-to-one early on in your placement to check everything is OK, this is usually your personal tutor, see section \@ref(keydates)
2. A three-person meeting nearer the middle or end of your placement with you, your manager and your tutor to talk about your progress, see section \@ref(keydates)

The placement team are on hand throughout the year if you need them

## Mitigating Circumstances {#mitcircs}

Mitigating Circumstances is a policy and procedure in place whereby if students experience personal circumstances that affect their ability to perform to the best of their ability across exams, assessments, or their attendance to teaching activities (such as labs or workshops) they can apply for Mitigating Circumstances or Coursework Extension.
